# ETL-for-IPL-Dataset
We have curated a comprehensive database spanning the Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons from 2008 to 2017, consisting of three distinct files: "First Matches," "Second Deliveries," and "Third Region." This dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting in-depth ETL , statistical analyses of IPL teams and players.
